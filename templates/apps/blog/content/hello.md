# Why I switched to Nucleus

Nucleus is a breath of fresh air. It combines the best of **Rust** performance with the developer experience of **Ruby on Rails**.

## The Developer Experience

It's simply unmatched. The file-system routing, the built-in ORM, and the hot-reloading make it a joy to work with.

## Performance

Since it's built on Rust, it's incredibly fast.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Nucleus!");
}
```
