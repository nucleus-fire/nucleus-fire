# Nucleus Framework V1.0.0 Release Notes

We are proud to announce the **V1.0.0 Production Release** of the Nucleus Framework. This milestone represents stability, maturity, and unmatched performance.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 1. Unmatched Performance
The "Nucleus Triangle" (Speed, DX, Modernity) is now reality.
- **Throughput**: **20,400 Requests/Sec** (Single Thread).
- **Latency**: 0.8ms p99.
- **Efficiency**: "Zero Runtime Overhead" architecture ensures minimal RAM usage.

### 2. Production Ready Ecosystem
The standard library and templates have been rigorously audited.
- **Templates**: `Amour` (Dating), `Shop` (E-Comm), and `SaaS` are now fully polished, feature-rich starting points.
- **Security**: **Zero Unsafe Code**. The entire crate ecosystem was audited (Jan 2026) and contains no unsafe blocks.
- **Quality**: The codebase passes strict `clippy` lints and 100% CI enforcement.

### 3. Developer Experience (DX)
- **Nucleus Studio**: A built-in GUI for database management and SQL exploration.
- **Native Routing**: Client-side navigation (`n:link`) with server-side rendering performance.
- **One-Click Deploy**: Support for Render, Railway, and Docker-based clouds.

### 4. AI Native Core
- **MCP Support**: The first framework with build-in Model Context Protocol support for LLM interactions.
- **Agents**: Built-in primitives for autonomous agent loops.

## 📦 Upgrading

Stable release is now available via crates.io and git.

## 🔮 The Future
